NIM_ADD (0x00000000)
0x00000000. Adds an icon to the status area. The icon is given an identifier in the NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdataâ€”either through its uID or guidItem member. This identifier is used in subsequent calls to Shell_NotifyIcon to perform later actions on the icon.
NIM_MODIFY (0x00000001)
0x00000001. Modifies an icon in the status area. NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdata uses the ID originally assigned to the icon when it was added to the notification area (NIM_ADD) to identify the icon to be modified.
NIM_DELETE (0x00000002)
0x00000002. Deletes an icon from the status area. NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdata uses the ID originally assigned to the icon when it was added to the notification area (NIM_ADD) to identify the icon to be deleted.
NIM_SETFOCUS (0x00000003)
0x00000003. Shell32.dll version 5.0 and later only. Returns focus to the taskbar notification area. Notification area icons should use this message when they have completed their UI operation. For example, if the icon displays a shortcut menu, but the user presses ESC to cancel it, use NIM_SETFOCUS to return focus to the notification area.
NIM_SETVERSION (0x00000004)
0x00000004. Shell32.dll version 5.0 and later only. Instructs the notification area to behave according to the version number specified in the uVersion member of the structure pointed to by lpdata. The version number specifies which members are recognized.
NIM_SETVERSION must be called every time a notification area icon is added (NIM_ADD)>. It does not need to be called with NIM_MOFIDY. The version setting is not persisted once a user logs off.
For details, see the Remarks section.
